- This file satisfies the instructions for the authors of [Turkish Journal of Electronical Engineering & Computer Sciences](https://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/elektrik/index.htm)
,

References must be numbered in square brackets within the article and listed in order of their first appearance in the text.
All authors should be included in reference lists unless there are 6 or more, in which case only the first 5 should be given,
followed by et al. (not italicized). Within the manuscript, cite references by their given number, again in square brackets. Do
not use individual sets of brackets for citation numbers that appear together, e.g., [2,6], not [2], [6]. Do not include personal
communications, unpublished data, or other unpublished materials as references, although such material may be inserted as
footnotes in the text. In the case of publications in languages other than English, the published English title should be provided
if one exists, with an annotation such as “(in Turkish)”. If the publication was not published with an English title, cite the original
title only; do not provide a self-translation. Please transliterate the titles of publications published in non-Latin alphabets.
Please ensure that author names are given exactly as they were published; e.g., if the names of Turkish authors were originally
published with Turkish characters, include the Turkish characters: Güneş et al. [2]. If the original publication did not use Turkish
characters, do not include them in your citations: Gunes et al. [2].


The reference list must not contain more than 10, 20, 30, 120, and 60 references for letters to the editor, case reports, short
communications, review articles, and research articles, respectively.

References should be formatted as follows (please note the punctuation
and capitalization):

**Journal articles**

Journal titles should not be abbreviated; the whole name of the journal should be given. Include the doi
number if one exists.
